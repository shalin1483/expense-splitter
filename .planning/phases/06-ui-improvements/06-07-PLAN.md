<objective>
Human verification of the complete Phase 6 UI upgrade across all six success criteria.

Purpose: Visual and interactive features cannot be verified by automated tests — dark mode rendering, animation smoothness, toast display, mobile touch targets, and overall polish require a human to confirm the experience. This is the gate before the phase is marked complete.

Output: User confirmation that all 6 success criteria pass, or a list of issues to address.

  <name>Task 1: Run full test suite and start dev server</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run the full test suite to confirm no regressions from any of the migration plans:
```bash
npm test 2>&1 | tail -30
```
Expected: All tests pass (exit 0).

Then start the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at http://localhost:5173

  <verify>
`npm test` exits 0 — report the number of tests that passed.
Dev server starts on port 5173.

What was built in Phase 6:
- Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui installed and wired into Vite
- App.css replaced with design token foundation
- Dark mode hook with localStorage persistence
- Dark mode toggle in header (sun/moon icon)
- BillWizard progress bar (shadcn/ui Progress component)
- Wizard step directional slide animations (motion AnimatePresence)
- PeopleStep, ItemsStep, AssignmentStep, TaxTipStep, ResultsStep, HistoryList — all migrated to Tailwind
- Save to History fires sonner toast instead of inline "Saved!" text

Visit http://localhost:5173 and verify each criterion:

Criterion 1 — Tailwind + tokens working: The app renders without a white flash or CSS error. The header says "Expense Splitter" with visible styling (not raw unstyled HTML).

Criterion 2 — shadcn/ui components: The wizard header shows a colored progress bar (not the old "Step 1 of 5" text). Buttons have visible rounded corners.

Criterion 3 — Dark mode: Click the moon icon in the top-right corner. The entire app switches to a dark background. Refresh — dark mode persists. Click the sun icon to switch back.

Criterion 4 — Step transition animations: Add 2+ people, click Next. Observe the step content slide in from the right. Click Back — slide in from the left. Animation is ~200ms and smooth.

Criterion 5 — Toast notification: Complete a full bill split, click "Save to History". A toast notification appears at the bottom saying "Split saved to history!" — not inline button text.

Criterion 6 — Existing functionality: Complete a full bill split end-to-end: add people, items, assign items, set tax and tip, view results, save to history, view history, expand a history entry.
