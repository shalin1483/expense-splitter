## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Group tip (not per-person) — Simplifies UX, covers 90% of real-world cases
- People-first flow — Mirrors natural receipt reading; need to know who's at table before assigning items
- Local storage for history — No backend complexity, still useful for personal reference
- Tax as rate OR exact amount — Some receipts show rate, others show total tax — support both

### Pending Todos
